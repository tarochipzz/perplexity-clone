# Perplexity.ai Frontend Recreation

https://perplexity-clone-x2hs.vercel.app/

## Overview

This project is a recreation of Perplexity.ai's core frontend experience, showcasing my ability to design and build responsive user interfaces. Given my professional background in SaaS companies (where my work isn't publicly accessible), this project demonstrates my initiative, technical proficiency, design sense, and product-focused engineering abilities using Perplexity's stated tech stack (nextjs, typescript, tailwind, react).

The data and streaming response is mocked while only the homepage and threads pages are implemented, this was an intentional decision to focused on delivering a MVP that would highlight:
- My initiative and ability to self-direct a project from scratch
- Attention to user experience and design alignment with Perplexity's brand identity
- Clean code suitable for a growing product

## Key Features & Highlights

- **Homepage & Thread Pages:** Focused on core functionality to highlight MVP delivery and design execution.
- **Mocked Streaming Data:** Simulates real-time response behavior without incurring API costs, demonstrating understanding of streaming concepts.
- **Reusable React Components:** Built with scalability in mind, showing the ability to manage state and component abstractions in large-scale codebases.
- **Optimized Performance:** Emphasis on rendering efficiency and interaction performance for a smooth user experience.
- **Accessible UI Elements:** Designed with accessibility best practices, ensuring inclusive user interactions.

## Notes

- Interpreting the brand's aesthetic based on [Perplexity's branding article](https://medium.com/smith-diction/branding-perplexity-ai-70eb2cb2ef48) and Instagram presence, it gives a _"Calm, introspective, effortless, futuristic but retro"_ vibe, I aimed to replicate this tone and generated the background image via a ChatGPT prompt.
- Check out dark vs light mode, responsiveness and subtle animations
