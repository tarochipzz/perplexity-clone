## 1. Types of Beans

### Arabica
Arabica beans are the most popular and widely consumed coffee beans, accounting for about 60-70% of global coffee production.

### Robusta
Robusta beans are known for their strong, bold flavor and higher caffeine content compared to Arabica beans.  
They are often used in espresso blends to add body and crema to the shot.

### Excelsa
Excelsa beans are known for their unique flavor profile, combining light and dark roast traits.

## 2. Best Brewing Methods

### _Pour-over_
**Ideal for:** Arabica, Excelsa  
This method highlights the delicate flavors and aromas of high-quality single-origin coffees.

### _Espresso_

Espresso brewing can showcase the complexity of Arabica or harness the strong flavors and crema-producing qualities of Robusta.

### _French press_
**Ideal for:** Robusta, Liberica  
The full immersion brewing process extracts bold flavors and oils, complementing the characteristics of these bean types.
